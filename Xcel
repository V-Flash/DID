            								  <p>Ans 1: We look for resumés of English teachers on our website, Facebook or LinkedIn. We keep an eye out for candidates who will be able to conduct phonics and grammar classes. If we find your resumé to be favourable, we will contact you and set up a test to judge your proficiency in the language. This is to determine your command over English. If you clear the test with a reasonably good score, we will then set up an interview to discuss the other parameters of your position. </p>

            								  <p>Ans 1. Little Genius provides a diagnostic level test to determine the level of enthusiasm and knowledge in English your child has. This test especially helps us to understand exactly what your child needs and then to assign an appropriate level. It is possible that your child may study at a higher level in school but is assigned a lower level in our phonics and grammar classes. That is solely because we cover an extensive syllabus and your child will benefit well in the assigned level. We work with you parents as a team to give the best education and course of learning to your child. </p>
